# Welcome!

We are excited to share our journey with you. Ideally, this blog supports **Markdown** which renders clearly and concisely.

## Why Markdown?

1. It's simple.
2. It's portable.
3. It keeps content separate from code.

Here is a code snippet:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Enjoy your stay!
